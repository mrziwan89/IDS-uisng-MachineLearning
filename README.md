# Perfecting Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning

>## Need of this project 
> An Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning can serve many purpose in the Field of Cyber Security, such as it would minimize the human intervention level while detecting or tackling with threats, not only that but also it can be used to optimize and expand the field of searching while looking and analyzation of threats.

## Pre-requisites
* Python virtualenv
* pip
* TensorFlow `pip install tensorflow-cpu`
* Pandas `pip install pandas`
* NumPy `pip install numpy`
* scikit-learn `pip install scikit-learn`
* Keras `pip install keras`
* Streamlit `pip install streamlit`
* Dataset [kddcup.data_10_percent.gz](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup.data_10_percent.gz). For more details about [this dataset](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/task.html)

*Check all the pre-requisites fullfilled in your environment by `pip freeze`*

## Run Code
>First open the folder having the file and start virtualenv and install all the pre-requisites then

run `py Code(Run).py` to check validation score on the aforementioned reduced dataset. 

## Deployment
>First open the folder having the file and start virtualenv and install all the pre-requisites then

run the code type `streamlit run Code(localhost).py` to deploy on localhost
